# Amazon Vine Analysis


## Overview of the analysis: 
Amazon has created a program that allows manufacturers and publishers to receive reviews for their product. The program (Amazon Vine) profits from companies paying a small fee to Amazon and provide products to Amazon Vine members (who are also paying), who are then required to publish a review on the products received. This analysis will determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviews from Vine members by analyzing the reviews from the Sporting Goods dataset selected.


## Results:
Before diving into the Vine reviews and star rating, other information needed to be pulled and put into dataframes and tables to better analyze and look at the data.
